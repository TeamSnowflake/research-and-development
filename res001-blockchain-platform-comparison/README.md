### Consensus mechanism

#### Public

##### Rootstock, PoW
Proof of Work. Rootstock is a Sidechain of Bitcoin and can be merge-mined.
The merge-mining functionality allows Bitcoin miners to mine in both chains with almost no extra cost. This will provide them extra revenues based on fees and allow them to participate in the smart contracts business.

##### Ethereum, PoW
Proof of Work.

##### EOS, dPoS
Delegated Proof of Stake. Under dPoS, those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers.

##### NEO, dBFT
Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. dBFT protocol occurs through a “gamified” form of block verification among professional node operators. All of these professional nodes are appointed by ordinary nodes through a delegated voting process. The professional node broadcasts its version of the blockchain to the network. If 66% of the other nodes agree with the information, consensus is achieved. Should this threshold not be met, a different professional node is appointed to broadcast its blockchain version until consensus can be established.

The dBFT protocol has not yet proven itself on heavy use. There are still some issues open on the NEO github about the voting system.)

##### NEM, PoI
Proof of Importance. PoI is the algorithm used in NEM to time stamp transactions. A NEM user's importance is determined by how many coins they have and the number of transactions made to and from their wallet. POI uses the NCDawareRank network centrality measure, the topology of the transaction graph, as well as a number of other relevant signals to achieve consensus.

#### Private

##### Multichain, pBFT
It's close to Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Distributed consensus between identified block validators. It's close in spirit to something like PBFT, but instead of multiple validators per block, there is one validator per block, working in a round-robin type of fashion. 

##### Hyperledger, Modulare
The consensus algoritme is modulare. Implementations can choose their own. The hyperledger implementation of IBM, Fabric has three consensus mechanisms: Solo, Kafka orderer, pBFT. The implementation of Intel utilises a novel consensus mechanism known as "Proof of Elapsed Time". A lottery-design consensus protocol that builds on trusted execution environments.

##### COCO, Modulare
While consensus is a fundamental aspect of any distributed network, compared to public blockchain networks, a Coco network is unique in that every VN fully trusts every other VN in the network. Because of this, no need exists to defend against Byzantine faults. The Coco Framework is designed to support pluggable consensus algorithms—with plans to initially integrate Paxos-like consensus algorithms and Caesar consensus, an algorithm from Microsoft Research. Coco networks can be built with other consensus algorithms; to achieve efficient agreement and maximum throughput, ideal implementations should take advantage of the fact that a message received over a secure channel from a trusted VN is itself trusted. 

#### Quorum, Modulare
With no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Quorum instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:
- Raft-based Consensus - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation
- Istanbul BFT - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.

#### Corda, Modulare
Corda uses special notary nodes to solve transaction races (i.e. reach consensus) and different consensus algorithms can be used on the same network.

### Fueling the blockchain (incentive)

#### Public 

##### Rootstock
Bitcoin rewards when merge mined by bitcoin miners. The smart bitcoins mined through RSK would power the startup's smart contract ecosystem. Whoever owns / ends up owning the RTC on the sidechain can get the Bitcoin back that were locked on the Bitcoin main blockchain to create the RTC. So if a miner gets fees in RTC they actually own Bitcoin as soon as they unlock them again on the mainchain. Bitcoin miners get RTC in the rootstock sidechain that can unlock bitcoins in the main chain.

##### Ethereum
The fundamental unit of computation is "gas"; usually, a computational step costs 1 gas, but some operations cost higher amounts of gas because they are more computationally expensive, or increase the amount of data that must be stored as part of the state. There is also a fee of 5 gas for every byte in the transaction data. The intent of the fee system is to require an attacker to pay proportionately for every resource that they consume, including computation, bandwidth and storage; hence, any transaction that leads to the network consuming a greater amount of any of these resources must have a gas fee roughly proportional to the increment. 

##### EOS
Separating Transaction costs from Token Value; One of the major benefits of the EOS.IO software is that the amount of bandwidth available to an application is entirely independent of any token price. If an application owner holds a relevant number of tokens, then the application can run indefinitely within a fixed state and bandwidth usage. Developers and users are unaffected from any price volatility in the token market and therefore not reliant on a price feed. The EOS.IO software enables block producers to naturally increase bandwidth, computation, and storage available per token independent of the token's value.

The EOS.IO software awards block producers tokens every time they produce the block. The value of the tokens will impact the amount of bandwidth, storage, and computation a producer can afford to purchase; this model naturally leverages rising token values to increase network performance.

##### NEO
GAS is the fuel token for the realization of NEO network resource control, with a maximum total limit of 100 million. The NEO network charges for the operation and storage of tokens and smart contracts, thereby creating economic incentives for bookkeepers and preventing the abuse of resources. The minimum unit of GAS is 0.00000001

##### NEM
The process of creating new blocks is called harvesting. The harvesting account gets the
fees for the transactions in the block. This gives the harvester an incentive to add as
many transactions to the block as possible. Any account that has a vested balance of at
least 10,000 XEM is eligible to harvest.

NEM also has a supernode program, funded with XEM, set aside during Nemesis block.

#### Private

##### Multichain
MultiChain 1.0 was released August 2, 2017 and is production-ready. In a MultiChain blockchain, transaction fees and block rewards are zero by default. If the cost of mining a block is negligible, miners need no compensation for providing this service beyond their general stake in the blockchain’s smooth functioning. Alternatively miners might charge network
participants a fixed annual service fee, paid by traditional off blockchain means.

##### Hyperledger
Hyperledger is a umbrella project. Hyperledger incubates and promotes a range of business blockchain technologies, including distributed ledger frameworks, smart contract engines, client libraries, graphical interfaces, utility libraries and sample applications. The Hyperledger umbrella strategy encourages the re-use of common building blocks and enables rapid innovation of DLT components.

Some examples of the range of blockchain technologies / projects hosted by the Linux Company:
- Burrow is blockchain client (Monax and Intel)
- Fabric is a permissioned blockchain infrastructure (IBM)
- Iroha, fabric fork focus on mobile apps. (Soramitsu)
- Sawtooth is a permissioned blockchain infrastructure (Intel)

Tools:
- Cello, deployment tooling (IBM)
- Composer, package management (IBM)
- Explorer, analytics tooling (Intel, IBM, DTCC)
- Indy, framework for digital independent identities (Sovrin Foundation)

##### CoCo
CoCo is a framework that is not released yet. Microsoft idea is to not make a coin or blockchain platform. Instead they are going to make a service where you can create trusted code excecution environments (TEE's). Approved smart contract manifest (which code can run on the network). Trusted list of validating nodes etc. A dApp request (ethereum transaction for example) goes through CoCo, it decrypts it, then routes it to the appropriate blockchain adaptor for the protocol. The adapter starts a transaction set and interacts with components of the blockchain protocol subsystem (such as block generation logic and Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM) to process the transaction. The adapter commits the transaction set via a distributed store, which persists and replicates all state changes across the network using the configured consensus algorithm. Processing of a single transaction may result in several state changes.

##### Quorum
Quarom is a minimal-fork of go-ethereum. ‘Proof of work’ consensus algorithm has been replaced with ‘QuorumChain’ consensus, a vote-based consensus mechanism. The pricing of Gas has been removed, although Gas itself remains.

##### Corda
The notary services validate transaction with “uniqueness consensus”-mechanism and they will operate with their own SLAs in place, likely being compensated a fee for their services.

### Programming language Smart Contracts

#### Rootstock, Solidity

#### Ethereum, Solidity
Why Solidity is created: Smart Contracts are excecuted on Ethereum Virtual Machines. The decision was made to develop a language specifically tailored to the EVM execution environment. It is indeed probably a lot more work than porting an existing language syntax (!), but it also results in a usable environment. Where an existing language would result in suboptimal code excecution.

#### EOS, C++
C++ is a language that most programmers already know. There is a extensive amount of data regarding security and audits of c++.

#### NEO, C# and Java 
NEO supports C# and Java and wants to support more languages. They do this because they want to be 'programmer friendly'. NEO compiles these languages into their own OP_CODE. For example JAVA isn't compiled to JAVA bytecode. Neo saves the programmer time to learn NEO. This means that NEO doesn't use a JAVA compiler and therefore any JAVA library can't be used. Supporting different languages can also create a security nightmare. (code auditors need to understand different programming languages)


#### NEM, any language off-chain
"Smart Contracts are not on blockchain. This is by design as on chain smart contracts have posed serious risk for other blockchains, have presented scalability issues, and can lead to too much resources being wasted on the deployment of it. For NEM, smart contracts can be executed off chain, such as on company servers, and the transactions can be recorded on the blockchain through the NEM API. Instead on chain smart contracts, the below customizable smart assets can be used on chain."
